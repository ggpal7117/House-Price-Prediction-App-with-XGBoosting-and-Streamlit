In this project, I took a sample housing dataset from Kaggle to predict house prices in cities in the United States. This data involved data preprocessing, splitting, training and testing, hyperparameter tuning, and the creation of the app using Streamlit. 

# Model Creation
The first part of the project was pre-processing the data for model training and testing. Features such as Zip Code, City, State, and County were in categorical form, so one-hot encoding was needed. The next step was reordering the dataset's features to build an inference pipeline that would accurately make predictions. After this, we could split our data to fit it to the XGBoost Model.

# XGBoost Model
XGBoosting is an incredibly powerful machine learning algorithm built on gradient boosting.
